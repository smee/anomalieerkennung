* Algorithms
- bin all data to learn lasso models for different loads (low/medium/high wind)
- piecewise models per sensor to approximate pairwise nonlinear relationships?
- somehow deduplicate calculations in fading statistics (no need to recount values, averages for all correlations,variances,regressions)
- mutable state for ingesting data? most of the CPU time seems to get spent in comparing map entries, updating statistics
- fading statstics histogram: PDF, JS divergence
- power curve reconstruction: multiple confidence intervals/histograms per bin to find smaller drifts than just big deviations outside of prediction interval
- learn models for different regimes (seasons, wind load, temperature outside)

* UI
- Material UI?
  - too slow/inflexible:  https://github.com/madvas/cljs-react-material-ui
  - better: use pure css, write own component!
  - flexboxgrid as CSS only grid framework https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kristoferjoseph/flexboxgrid/master/dist/flexboxgrid.css
- generic table pagination

* Application
- Users, Roles, Permissions, Visibility
- Concept: Park
- heterogenous wind plants: how to visualize common/distinct sensor trees?
- handle different sensor data: averages only up to min/max/avg/sd tuples
  - DB queries
- generic ETL pipeline
- refine concept for generic algorithms: visualize different types, generic state persistence
